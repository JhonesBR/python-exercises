# Define a class attribute”color” with a default value white. I.e., Every Vehicle should be white.
# Use the following code for this exercise.
# class Vehicle:

#     def __init__(self, name, max_speed, mileage):
#         self.name = name
#         self.max_speed = max_speed
#         self.mileage = mileage

# class Bus(Vehicle):
